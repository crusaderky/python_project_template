TEMPLATE
========
TODO

This project contains all the boilerplate for initialising a new Python project on
github. It includes:

- Automated tests with py.test
- Enforced static code linting and validation with ruff, black and mypy,
  encapsulated by pre-commit
- Sphinx documentation framework
- Integration with github workflows, codecov.io, and readthedocs
- CI tests against multiple versions of Python (Anaconda distribution) and on multiple
  OSs (Linux, Windows, and MacOS)
- Explicit tests for minimum supported dependencies versions
- Automated versioning with setuptools-scm
- Step-by-step guide to release to pypi and conda-forge
